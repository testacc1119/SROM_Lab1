# SROM Дигас Богдан ФІ-03
## Lab 1
### Implemented all these features:

* Resizable bool array based on the std::deque chosen because of it's ability to push_front() and push_back(), essential for efficiency on a larger scale

* All bitwise operators, applied to bool type (&, |, ^, ~(!)) and bitshifts (>>, <<)

* All relational operators (>, <, >=, <=)

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the remainder and pow

* Binary string, int (int to string is easily implemented by the user) and hexadecimal string conversions

* sidenote: oldest positive bit is always the first one, so no need to implement search for it

## Lab 2
### Implemented all these features:

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, power using Barret reduction

* gcd, lcm by Euclidian and binary methods
